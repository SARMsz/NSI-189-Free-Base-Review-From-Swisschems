<h1>My Personal Review of NSI‑189 Free Base Powder from Swisschems</h1>

<p>I’ve spent the last six weeks experimenting with NSI‑189 Free Base Powder, a nootropic compound designed to support neurogenesis, mood and cognition. As someone who struggles with afternoon brain fog and mild low mood, I wanted a clean powder I could dose myself, track my results, and honestly share what I found.</p>

<p>Swisschems offers high‑purity NSI‑189, laboratory‑tested at ≥98% purity, with clear COA documentation. After unboxing, I dissolved it in distilled water, measured precise doses with my digital scale, and began my trial. If you want to try it yourself, <a href="https://swisschems.is/product/nsi-189-free-base-powder-1-gram/ref/277/?campaign=github" target="_blank">buy NSI‑189 Free Base Powder here</a> and see if it boosts your focus.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>

<p><strong>Dosage &amp; Schedule:</strong> I started at 5 mg daily, taken in the morning on an empty stomach, and ramped up by 2.5 mg each week until reaching 15 mg. I logged mood, focus, energy &amp; sleep quality every day in a simple spreadsheet.</p>

<p><strong>Blind Self‑Assessment:</strong> To reduce bias, I sometimes skipped doses without looking at my log, then rated my clarity on a 1–5 scale. This helped verify real effects versus placebo.</p>

<p><strong>Peer Feedback:</strong> I shared my experience with two friends who also tried NSI‑189. We compared notes on memory recall tests and mental stamina during work sessions.</p>

<h2>My Experience and Results</h2>

<p>Within the first week at 7.5 mg, I noticed crisper thinking around midday. My usual 3 pm slump was gentler. By week three at 12.5 mg, I felt a slight uplift in mood—more patience with emails and fewer negative thoughts.</p>

<p>Memory tests improved modestly. I used a simple “name‑that‑face” app and saw my recall accuracy move from 68% baseline to 78% after four weeks. Concentration during writing tasks increased as well; I could work in focused blocks of 45–60 minutes without distraction.</p>

<p>Sleep quality stayed stable, though I did feel slightly wired if I doubled my dose above 15 mg. That told me my sweet spot is 10–12.5 mg daily.</p>

<p>Overall ranking vs. five other nootropics in my rotation: #1 for sustained focus, #2 for mood, #3 for sleep support. Swisschems’ batch consistency and clear lab reports made it easy to trust my results.</p>
